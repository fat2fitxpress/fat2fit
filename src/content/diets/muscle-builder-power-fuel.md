## Power Lifter Nutrition Principles

### Calorie Requirements

- **Base calories:** Calculate TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
- **Surplus:** Add 300-500 calories for muscle growth
- **Adjust based on:** Training volume, intensity, and goals
- **Monitor:** Track weight and strength gains, adjust as needed

### Macronutrient Targets

- **Protein:** 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight (0.7-1.0g per pound)
- **Carbohydrates:** 4-7g per kg body weight (1.8-3.2g per pound)
- **Fats:** 0.8-1.2g per kg body weight (0.36-0.55g per pound)

### Meal Timing

- **Pre-workout:** Meal 1-2 hours before training (carbs + protein)
- **Post-workout:** Meal within 2 hours (protein + carbs for recovery)
- **Regular meals:** Distribute calories throughout the day
- **Bedtime snack:** Optional protein-rich snack if needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Not eating enough calories** - Powerlifters need significant calories
- **Insufficient protein** - High protein is crucial for muscle growth
- **Skipping carbs** - Carbs fuel training and support recovery
- **Poor meal timing** - Time nutrition around workouts
- **Ignoring recovery nutrition** - Post-workout nutrition is critical
- **Not tracking intake** - Monitor calories and macros for optimal results

## Nutrition Recommendations

To maximize powerlifter performance:

- **Eat enough calories** - Surplus needed for muscle growth
- **Prioritize protein** - High protein supports muscle repair and growth
- **Include carbs** - Fuel training and replenish glycogen
- **Time nutrition** - Eat around workouts for optimal performance
- **Stay hydrated** - Drink plenty of water throughout the day
- **Consider supplements** - Creatine, protein powder, BCAAs may help

Use our [Macro Calculator](/calculator) to determine your optimal calorie and macronutrient targets.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many calories do I need?

Most powerlifters need 3000-4000+ calories daily depending on size, training volume, and goals. Calculate your TDEE and add 300-500 calories for muscle growth.

### Can I build muscle without a surplus?

It's possible for beginners or those returning to training, but a surplus typically accelerates muscle growth. Monitor progress and adjust calories based on results.

### What about meal timing?

Eat regular meals throughout the day. Pre and post-workout nutrition is important, but total daily intake matters most. Don't stress about exact timing windows.

### Do I need supplements?

Supplements can help but aren't essential. Focus on whole foods first. Consider creatine, protein powder, and BCAAs if needed. Consult a professional for guidance.

### How do I know if I'm eating enough?

Track weight, strength gains, and energy levels. If gaining weight slowly (0.5-1 lb per week) and strength is increasing, you're likely eating enough. Adjust based on progress.

### What if I'm not hungry enough?

Eat calorie-dense foods, add healthy fats, drink calories (smoothies, milk), and eat more frequently. Powerlifters often need to make eating a priority.

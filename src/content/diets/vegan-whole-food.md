## Whole Food Plant Based Principles

### Core Components

- **Fruits** - All fruits, fresh or frozen (minimize dried)
- **Vegetables** - All vegetables, especially leafy greens
- **Whole grains** - Brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat
- **Legumes** - Beans, lentils, chickpeas, peas
- **Nuts and seeds** - In moderation, whole or minimally processed
- **Minimal processing** - Foods as close to natural state as possible

### What to Minimize or Avoid

- **Added oils** - Use whole food fats (nuts, seeds, avocado) instead
- **Refined sugars** - Use whole fruits for sweetness
- **Processed foods** - Minimize packaged and processed items
- **Refined grains** - Choose whole grains instead
- **Salt** - Use herbs and spices for flavor

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Not eating enough calories** - Whole foods are less calorie-dense; eat larger volumes
- **Insufficient protein** - Include legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds regularly
- **Too much fruit** - Balance with vegetables, grains, and legumes
- **Skipping B12** - Must supplement B12 (not found in plant foods)
- **Not planning meals** - Plan ahead to ensure balanced nutrition
- **Ignoring variety** - Eat diverse foods for complete nutrition

## Nutrition Recommendations

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to eliminate all oils?

Many WFPB advocates minimize added oils, using whole food fats instead. However, small amounts of high-quality oils (like extra virgin olive oil) can be included if desired. The key is minimizing processed foods.

### Can I get enough protein?

Yes! Legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds provide adequate protein. Most people need less protein than they think. Include legumes daily and vary protein sources.

### Is this diet expensive?

Not necessarily. Whole grains, legumes, and seasonal produce are often affordable. Buy in bulk, choose seasonal produce, and minimize processed foods to save money.

### What about B12 and other nutrients?

B12 must be supplemented. Consider D3 (especially in winter), omega-3s (flax, chia, walnuts), and iron (legumes, leafy greens with vitamin C). Get blood work to monitor levels.

### Can I eat out on this diet?

It's challenging but possible. Choose restaurants with plant-based options, request modifications, and focus on whole food choices. Many cuisines (Mediterranean, Asian) offer WFPB-friendly options.

### How do I ensure I'm eating enough?

Whole foods are less calorie-dense, so you may need larger portions. Include starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, corn), whole grains, and legumes. Listen to hunger cues and eat until satisfied.

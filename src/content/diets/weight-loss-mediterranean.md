## Mediterranean Weight Loss Principles

### Calorie Deficit

- **Moderate deficit:** 300-500 calories below maintenance
- **Sustainable approach:** Avoid extreme deficits
- **Monitor progress:** Aim for 0.5-1 lb weight loss per week
- **Adjust as needed:** Increase calories if losing too fast, decrease if stalled

### Food Choices

- **Abundant vegetables:** Fill half your plate with vegetables
- **Lean proteins:** Fish, poultry, legumes, occasional lean red meat
- **Healthy fats:** Olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado
- **Whole grains:** Quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat in moderation

### Portion Control

- **Use smaller plates:** Visual trick to control portions
- **Fill with vegetables:** Low-calorie, high-volume foods
- **Moderate proteins:** Palm-sized portions
- **Healthy fats:** Use sparingly but don't eliminate
- **Whole grains:** Moderate portions, not the main focus

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too much pasta/bread** - Grains should be moderate, not excessive
- **Not tracking portions** - Even healthy foods need portion control
- **Skipping meals** - Regular meals support metabolism

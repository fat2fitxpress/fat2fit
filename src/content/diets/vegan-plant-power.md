## Nutrition Recommendations

To maximize high-protein plant nutrition:

- **Aim for 1.2-2.0g protein per kg** (0.55-0.9g per pound) for active individuals
- **Include protein at every meal** - Distribute intake throughout the day
- **Combine protein sources** - Pair legumes with grains for complete proteins
- **Eat enough calories** - Adequate calories support protein utilization
- **Stay hydrated** - Protein metabolism requires adequate water
- **Supplement wisely** - Consider B12, D3, and omega-3s

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get enough protein on a vegan diet?

Absolutely! With proper planning, vegans can meet protein needs through legumes, soy products, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Many athletes successfully follow high-protein vegan diets.

### How do I ensure complete proteins?

Combine complementary proteins: legumes + grains (rice and beans), legumes + seeds (hummus), or eat complete proteins like quinoa, soy, or seitan. You don't need to combine at every meal, but include variety throughout the day.

### What if I'm not active? Do I need this much protein?

Less active individuals need less protein (0.8-1.0g per kg). This plan is designed for active individuals. Adjust portions based on your activity level.

### Can I build muscle on this plan?

Yes! Many successful vegan bodybuilders and athletes follow high-protein plant-based diets. Focus on adequate protein, calories, and strength training.

### What about protein powders?

Plant-based protein powders (pea, rice, hemp, soy) can help meet protein needs, especially post-workout. They're convenient but not necessary if you're meeting needs through whole foods.

### Is soy safe?

Yes, soy is safe and beneficial for most people. It provides complete protein and isoflavones. Choose whole soy foods (tofu, tempeh, edamame) over processed soy products.

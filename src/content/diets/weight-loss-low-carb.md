- **Very low carb:** Typically under 50g per day
- **Focus on vegetables:** Non-starchy vegetables are primary carb source
- **Avoid:** Grains, bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, fruits (initially)
- **Read labels:** Many foods contain hidden carbs

### Protein Requirements

- **High protein:** 1.6-2.2g per kg (0.7-1.0g per pound)
- **Preserve muscle:** Adequate protein maintains lean mass during weight loss
- **Satiety:** Protein promotes feelings of fullness
- **Distribute:** Include protein at every meal

### Fat Intake

- **Adequate fats:** 0.8-1.2g per kg (0.36-0.55g per pound)
- **Healthy sources:** Avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil, fatty fish
- **Satiety:** Fats help keep you full
- **Hormone support:** Adequate fats support hormone production

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Not eating enough protein** - High protein is crucial for muscle preservation
- **Too few calories** - Extreme deficits are unsustainable and counterproductive
- **Not drinking enough water** - Low-carb diets can cause dehydration
- **Ignoring vegetables** - Include non-starchy vegetables for nutrients
- **Not tracking accurately** - Hidden carbs can add up quickly
- **Skipping meals** - Regular meals support metabolism and satiety

## Nutrition Recommendations

To maximize low-carb weight loss:

- **Prioritize protein** - High protein preserves muscle and promotes satiety
- **Include healthy fats** - Fats support satiety and hormone production
- **Eat vegetables** - Non-starchy vegetables provide nutrients and fiber
- **Stay hydrated** - Drink plenty of water throughout the day
- **Track intake** - Monitor calories and carbs for optimal results

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How low should carbs be?

Most low-carb diets aim for under 50g per day. Some go lower (20-30g) for faster results. Start moderate and adjust based on results and how you feel.

### Will I lose muscle on low-carb?

Not if you eat enough protein. High protein (1.6-2.2g per kg) preserves muscle during weight loss. Include strength training for best results.

### Can I eat fruits?

Initially, many low-carb plans limit fruits due to sugar content. As you progress, you can add small amounts of berries. Focus on vegetables first.

### What about energy levels?

Some people experience low energy initially as the body adapts to burning fat. This usually improves after 1-2 weeks. Ensure adequate calories and protein.

### How long should I follow this plan?

Low-carb can be followed for weeks to months. Some people cycle (low-carb days, higher-carb days). Find what's sustainable for you.

### What if I'm not losing weight?

Check calorie intake - low-carb still requires a calorie deficit. Track accurately, ensure adequate protein, and be patient. Weight loss isn't always linear.

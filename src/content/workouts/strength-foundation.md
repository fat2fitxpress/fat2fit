## The Workout

### 1. Warm-up (10 mins)

A proper warm-up prepares your body for the workout ahead and reduces injury risk.

- **Dynamic stretching:** Leg swings, arm circles, torso twists (5 minutes)
- **Light cardio:** 5-10 minutes of walking or light cycling to increase heart rate and blood flow
- **Movement prep:** Bodyweight squats and arm circles to activate muscles

**Why it matters:** Warming up increases muscle temperature, improves flexibility, and prepares your nervous system for heavy lifting.

## Progression Tips

- **Progressive overload:** Once you can easily complete all sets at the top of the rep range, increase weight by 2.5-5 lbs in the next session
- **Form first:** Focus on perfect technique before adding more weight—quality over quantity
- **Track progress:** Stay consistent and log your lifts! Use a workout journal or app to track weights and reps
- **Rest days:** Don't skip rest days—muscle growth happens during recovery
- **Nutrition:** Ensure adequate protein intake (0.8-1g per pound of body weight) to support muscle growth

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Rushing through reps:** Control the weight throughout the entire range of motion
- **Skipping warm-ups:** Always warm up to prevent injury
- **Too much weight:** Start lighter to master form, then gradually increase
- **Inadequate rest:** Rest periods are crucial for strength gains
- **Neglecting core:** Core strength supports all compound movements

## Nutrition Recommendations

To maximize strength gains, pair this program with proper nutrition:

- **Protein:** 0.8-1g per pound of body weight daily
- **Carbs:** Include complex carbs pre and post-workout for energy
- **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day
- **Meal timing:** Eat a protein-rich meal within 2 hours post-workout

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long until I see results?

Most beginners notice strength improvements within 4-6 weeks of consistent training. Visible muscle changes typically appear after 8-12 weeks. Remember, consistency is more important than perfection.

### Can I do this program at home?

This program requires access to a gym with barbells, dumbbells, and a bench. If training at home, consider bodyweight alternatives or invest in adjustable dumbbells. Check out our [HIIT Starter](/workout-plan/hiit-starter) program for home-friendly options.

### What if I can't complete all reps?

Start with lighter weights and focus on completing all sets with proper form. It's better to use lighter weight with perfect form than heavy weight with poor technique. Gradually increase weight as you get stronger.

### Should I do cardio with this program?

Yes, moderate cardio 2-3 times per week is beneficial. However, avoid excessive cardio that might interfere with recovery. Consider our [Cardio Kickstart](/workout-plan/cardio-kickstart) program for structured cardio training.

### How do I know when to move to the next level?

When you can consistently add weight each week and complete all sets with proper form, you're ready for intermediate programs like [Power Builder](/workout-plan/power-builder). This typically takes 3-6 months of consistent training.

## Cool-down (10 minutes)

After completing all rounds, cool down thoroughly:

- **Light walking:** 5 minutes
- **Static stretching:** Hold each stretch 60 seconds
  - Quad stretch
  - Hamstring stretch
  - Calf stretch
  - Chest stretch
  - Shoulder stretch
- **Deep breathing:** 2-3 minutes
- **Foam rolling:** 5 minutes (if available)

**Why cool-down matters:** Extreme intensity requires thorough cool-down to promote recovery and prevent injury.

## Safety & Recovery

**Critical Guidelines:**

- **Limit to 2 sessions per week maximum** - This program is extremely taxing
- **2-3 rest days between sessions** - Your CNS needs recovery time
- **Focus on active recovery** - Walking, light stretching, yoga on rest days
- **Advanced hydration** - Drink water with electrolytes during and after
- **Monitor recovery** - Track resting heart rate and sleep quality
- **Listen to your body** - If you feel overtrained, take extra rest

**Why it matters:** Extreme training requires extreme recovery. Overtraining leads to injury, burnout, and decreased performance.

## Nutrition for Extreme HIIT

To fuel and recover from extreme training:

- **Pre-workout:** Light meal 1-2 hours before (complex carbs + protein)
- **During workout:** Hydrate with electrolytes if session exceeds 30 minutes
- **Post-workout:** Protein + carbs within 30 minutes (critical for recovery)
- **Daily protein:** 0.9-1.1g per pound to support recovery
- **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day
- **Consider supplements:** BCAAs, electrolytes, creatine (consult professional)

Use our [Macro Calculator](/calculator) to determine your optimal nutrition plan.

## Tips for Success

- **Master intermediate HIIT first** - Don't attempt this without solid foundation
- **Track metrics** - Monitor resting heart rate, sleep, and recovery
- **Prioritize recovery** - Sleep, nutrition, and rest are crucial
- **Periodize training** - Follow this program for 4-6 weeks, then deload
- **Work with a coach** - Consider professional guidance for safety
- **Stay consistent** - But not at the expense of recovery

## Progression Plan

**Weeks 1-2:** Complete 3 rounds, focus on form and intensity  
**Weeks 3-4:** Complete 4 rounds, maintain intensity  
**Weeks 5-6:** Complete all 5 rounds, push intensity  
**Weeks 7-8:** Deload week (reduce to 2-3 rounds), then reassess

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Training too frequently** - Limit to 2x per week maximum
- **Insufficient recovery** - Extreme training requires extreme recovery
- **Poor form when fatigued** - Maintain form or reduce intensity
- **Ignoring warning signs** - Rest when overtrained
- **Skipping warm-up/cool-down** - Essential for safety
- **Inadequate nutrition** - Fuel properly for extreme training

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if I'm ready for this program?

You should have 1+ year of HIIT experience, be able to complete intermediate HIIT programs easily, and have excellent recovery capacity. If not, start with [HIIT Starter](/workout-plan/hiit-starter) or [Full Body Shred](/workout-plan/full-body-shred).

### Can I do this program more than twice per week?

No. This program is extremely taxing on your central nervous system. More than 2 sessions per week will lead to overtraining, injury, and decreased performance.

### What if I can't complete all 5 rounds?

Start with 3 rounds and build up gradually. It's better to complete fewer rounds with maximum intensity than to struggle through more rounds at reduced intensity.

### Should I combine this with other training?

Be very careful. This program is extremely demanding. If combining with other training, ensure adequate recovery. Consider reducing other intense training while following this program.

### How do I know if I'm overtrained?

Signs include: increased resting heart rate, poor sleep, decreased performance, persistent fatigue, mood changes, frequent illness. If you experience these, take extra rest.

### Can beginners do this program?

No. This program is for advanced athletes only. Beginners should start with [HIIT Starter](/workout-plan/hiit-starter) and progress gradually.

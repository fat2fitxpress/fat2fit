- Stay relaxed during easy portions
- Push hard during sprint portions

**Video tutorial:** [Fartlek Training Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID)

**Benefits:** Improves speed, endurance, and mental engagement

**Progression:** Increase sprint duration or decrease recovery time

### Speed Work (Track Session)

High-intensity intervals that push VO2 max and improve running economy.

- **Duration:** 45-60 minutes total (including warm-up and cool-down)
- **Workout:** 800m repeats x 6 with 90 seconds recovery
- **Intensity:** 85-95% max effort during intervals
- **Focus:** Maintain consistent pace across all intervals
- **Frequency:** 1 time per week

**Form cues:**
- Start each interval strong but controlled
- Maintain form throughout (don't break down)
- Use recovery period to fully recover
- Focus on efficient stride and arm swing
- Stay relaxed but powerful

**Video tutorial:** [Track Interval Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID)

**Benefits:** Improves VO2 max, running economy, and mental toughness

**Progression:** Increase number of intervals, decrease recovery time, or increase distance

### Recovery Cardio

Active recovery that promotes blood flow and aids in recovery without adding stress.

- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Intensity:** Very light (Zone 1, 50-60% max heart rate)
- **Activity:** Light swimming or cycling to flush out lactic acid
- **Focus:** Easy, relaxed movement
- **Frequency:** 1-2 times per week

**Form cues:**
- Keep effort very easy
- Focus on smooth, relaxed movement
- Use this as active recovery, not training
- Stay in Zone 1 heart rate
- Enjoy the movement

**Benefits:** Promotes recovery, improves circulation, maintains fitness

**Modification:** Can be replaced with easy walk or yoga

---

## Cool-down (10-15 minutes)

After every session:

- **Light walking/jogging:** 5-10 minutes
- **Static stretching:** Hold each stretch 30-60 seconds
  - Quad stretch
  - Hamstring stretch
  - Calf stretch
  - Hip flexor stretch
- **Deep breathing:** 2-3 minutes

**Why cool-down matters:** Helps heart rate return to normal, promotes recovery, improves flexibility.

## Advanced Metrics

Track these metrics to monitor progress and prevent overtraining:

- **Resting Heart Rate (RHR)** - Monitor daily; increases may indicate overtraining
- **VO2 Max** - Test every 8-12 weeks to measure improvement
- **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** - Daily monitoring can indicate recovery status
- **Training Load** - Track weekly volume and intensity
- **Perceived Exertion** - Rate workouts on 1-10 scale

**Why it matters:** Advanced training requires careful monitoring to optimize performance and prevent overtraining.

## Nutrition for Elite Cardio

To fuel elite-level training:

- **High-carb intake on long distance days** - Ensures glycogen storage for endurance
- **Protein:** 0.8-1g per pound to support recovery
- **Hydration:** Critical - drink before, during, and after sessions
- **Electrolytes:** Replace during long sessions (sodium, potassium, magnesium)
- **Pre-workout:** Carbs 30-60 minutes before long sessions
- **Post-workout:** Protein + carbs within 30 minutes for recovery

Use our [Macro Calculator](/calculator) to determine your optimal nutrition plan.

## Tips for Success

- **Listen to your body** - Elite training is demanding; rest when needed
- **Track metrics** - Monitor RHR, HRV, and performance data
- **Prioritize recovery** - Sleep, nutrition, and rest are crucial
- **Periodize training** - Build in deload weeks every 4-6 weeks
- **Stay consistent** - Elite fitness requires long-term commitment
- **Work with a coach** - Consider professional guidance for optimal results

## Progression Plan

**Weeks 1-2:** Establish baseline, complete all sessions  
**Weeks 3-4:** Increase volume by 10-15%  
**Weeks 5-6:** Increase intensity or add extra sessions  
**Weeks 7-8:** Deload week (reduce volume by 30-40%), then repeat cycle

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Overtraining** - Elite training is demanding; don't skip rest days
- **Ignoring recovery** - Recovery is when adaptation happens
- **Poor nutrition** - Elite training requires elite nutrition
- **Neglecting metrics** - Track RHR and HRV to prevent overtraining
- **No periodization** - Build in deload weeks to prevent burnout
- **Skipping warm-up/cool-down** - Essential for performance and injury prevention

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if I'm ready for this program?

You should have 1+ year of consistent training, be able to run 60+ minutes comfortably, and have experience with interval training. If not, start with [Endurance Runner](/workout-plan/endurance-runner) or [Cardio Kickstart](/workout-plan/cardio-kickstart).

### Can I do this program year-round?

No. Elite training requires periodization. Follow this program for 8-12 weeks, then take a deload week or switch to maintenance training for 2-4 weeks before returning.

### What if my resting heart rate increases?

Increased RHR often indicates overtraining or insufficient recovery. Take extra rest days, reduce volume, and ensure adequate sleep and nutrition.

### Should I track my VO2 max?

Yes, but you don't need expensive equipment. Track performance metrics like pace, heart rate, and perceived exertion. Professional VO2 max testing every 8-12 weeks is ideal.

### How important is nutrition for elite cardio?

Extremely important. Elite training requires proper fueling. Inadequate nutrition will limit performance and increase injury risk.

### Can I combine this with strength training?

Yes, but be strategic. Limit strength training to 2-3 sessions per week, focus on maintenance rather than building, and ensure adequate recovery.

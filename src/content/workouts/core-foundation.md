- **Holding breath** - Breathe normally during exercises
- **Rushing** - Slow, controlled movements are more effective
- **Skipping warm-up** - Always prepare your body before training
- **Overtraining** - Don't do core work every day - rest is important

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long until I see results?

Most beginners notice improved core strength and stability within 2-3 weeks. Visible changes may take 6-12 weeks depending on your starting point and nutrition.

### Can I do this program every day?

No. Your core muscles need recovery time. Stick to 3 times per week with rest days between sessions. Overtraining can lead to injury and hinder progress.

### What if I can't hold a plank for 30 seconds?

Start with 10-15 seconds and gradually increase. Even 10 seconds with perfect form is better than 30 seconds with poor form. You'll build strength quickly!

### Should I combine this with other workouts?

Yes! This program pairs perfectly with strength training, cardio, or other beginner programs. Core strength supports all other activities.

### Do I need equipment?

No equipment is required, though an exercise mat makes it more comfortable. You can do all exercises on a carpeted floor or grass.

### How do I know when to progress?

When you can easily complete all sets with proper form, increase hold times, reps, or move to the [Core Sculptor](/workout-plan/core-sculptor) program.

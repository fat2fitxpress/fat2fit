## The Program

### Intensity: Moderate (Conversational)

You should be able to speak a full sentence without GASPING for air, but still feel your heart rate elevated. This is Zone 2 training - comfortable but working.

**How to gauge intensity:**
- **Too easy:** You can sing or have long conversations easily
- **Just right:** You can speak in full sentences but feel your heart working
- **Too hard:** You're gasping and can only say a few words

### Week 1-2: 20-25 Minutes

Build your foundation with these activities. Choose one per session:

#### Walking at a Brisk Pace (3.5 - 4.0 mph)

Excellent low-impact option for beginners.

  - Calf stretch
  - Shoulder stretch
- **Deep breathing:** 1-2 minutes

**Why cool-down matters:** Helps heart rate return to normal gradually, promotes recovery, improves flexibility.

## Tips for Success

- **Start slow** - It's better to go too easy than too hard as a beginner
- **Be consistent** - 3-4 times per week consistently beats sporadic intense sessions
- **Listen to your body** - Rest when needed, don't push through pain
- **Track progress** - Note how you feel, duration, and intensity
- **Stay hydrated** - Drink water before, during (if needed), and after
- **Enjoy it** - Find activities you enjoy to maintain motivation

## Progression Plan

**Weeks 1-2:** Focus on establishing routine, complete all sessions  
**Weeks 3-4:** Increase duration and introduce intervals  
**Weeks 5-6:** Increase to 30-35 minutes or add more intervals  
**Weeks 7-8:** Progress to [Endurance Runner](/workout-plan/endurance-runner) or continue building

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Going too hard too soon** - Start easy and build gradually
- **Skipping warm-up/cool-down** - Essential for safety and recovery
- **Inconsistent schedule** - Regular sessions are key to improvement
- **Ignoring pain** - Pain is different from discomfort; rest when injured
- **Comparing to others** - Focus on your own progress, not others
- **Skipping rest days** - Rest is when your body adapts and gets stronger

## Nutrition for Cardio Training

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if I'm working hard enough?

You should be able to speak in full sentences but feel your heart working. If you can sing easily, go faster. If you're gasping, slow down.

### Can I do this program every day?

No. Beginners should do cardio 3-4 times per week with rest days between. Your body needs recovery time to adapt and get stronger.

### What if I can't complete the full duration?

Start with shorter durations (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase by 2-5 minutes each week. It's better to complete shorter sessions consistently than to struggle through longer ones.

### Should I do the same activity every time?

Variety is good! Mix walking, cycling, and swimming to work different muscles and prevent boredom. You can also try elliptical, rowing, or other low-impact options.

### What if I have joint pain?

Choose low-impact options like swimming, cycling, or elliptical. If pain persists, consult a healthcare provider before continuing.

### How long until I see results?

Most beginners notice improved energy and endurance within 2-3 weeks. Visible changes in fitness typically occur after 4-8 weeks of consistent training.

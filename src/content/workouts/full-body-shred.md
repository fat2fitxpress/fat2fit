# Full Body Shred (Intermediate)

An intense circuit training program designed to torch fat and build lean muscle across your entire body. This intermediate program combines strength and cardio in a time-efficient format that maximizes calorie burn while building functional strength.

## Program Overview

The Full Body Shred program uses high-intensity circuit training to create a powerful metabolic response. Each exercise targets multiple muscle groups while maintaining elevated heart rate, resulting in exceptional fat loss and muscle definition. Perfect for those who want maximum results in minimal time.

**Target Audience:** Intermediate fitness enthusiasts (3-6 months of consistent training)  
**Duration:** 30-35 minutes per session  
**Frequency:** 3-4 times per week with rest days between sessions  
**Equipment Needed:** Kettlebell (or dumbbell), battle ropes (or alternative), pull-up bar (optional), mat

## Benefits of Full Body Circuit Training

- **Maximum calorie burn** - High intensity creates exceptional calorie expenditure
- **Afterburn effect** - EPOC continues burning calories for hours post-workout
- **Full-body strength** - Targets all major muscle groups in each session
- **Time efficient** - Maximum results in 30-35 minutes
- **Improved cardiovascular fitness** - Builds both strength and endurance
- **Muscle definition** - Builds lean muscle while burning fat
- **Functional fitness** - Movements translate to daily activities

## Structure

- **Work:** 40 seconds
- **Rest:** 20 seconds
- **Total Rounds:** 4 complete circuits
- **Target Duration:** 30-35 minutes (including warm-up and cool-down)

The 2:1 work-to-rest ratio provides challenging intensity while allowing adequate recovery to maintain form and power.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)

Before starting, prepare your body:

- **Light jogging in place:** 2 minutes

## Cool-down (5 minutes)

After completing all rounds:

- **Light walking:** 2-3 minutes
- **Static stretching:** Hold each stretch 30-60 seconds
  - Quad stretch
  - Hamstring stretch
  - Calf stretch
  - Chest stretch
  - Shoulder stretch
- **Deep breathing:** 1-2 minutes

**Why cool-down matters:** Helps heart rate return to normal, promotes recovery, improves flexibility.

## Performance Goals

- **Try to maintain the same number of reps in the 4th round as the 1st** - This shows improved endurance
- **Focus on explosive power during the "work" phase** - Quality over quantity
- **Minimal rest between rounds** - 60 seconds maximum to maintain intensity
- **Track your reps** - Log reps per exercise to measure improvement

**Why it matters:** Progressive improvement in maintaining intensity across rounds indicates improved fitness and endurance.

## Nutrition for Fat Loss

To maximize fat loss while preserving muscle:

- **Caloric deficit:** 300-500 calories below maintenance
- **High protein:** 0.8-1g per pound to preserve muscle mass
- **Complex carbs:** Include around workouts for energy
- **Healthy fats:** Essential for hormone production
- **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day
- **Post-workout:** Protein + carbs within 30 minutes

## Tips for Success

- **Form over speed** - Maintain proper form even when fatigued
- **Track progress** - Log reps per exercise to measure improvement
- **Stay consistent** - 3-4 sessions per week consistently beats sporadic intense sessions
- **Listen to your body** - Rest when needed, don't push through pain
- **Progressive overload** - Increase reps, weight, or intensity as you get stronger
- **Recovery is key** - Rest days are when adaptation happens

## Progression Plan

**Weeks 1-2:** Focus on form, complete all 4 rounds  
**Weeks 3-4:** Increase reps by 10-20% or add weight  
**Weeks 5-6:** Add a 5th round or increase work time to 45 seconds  
**Weeks 7-8:** Increase intensity or move to [Extreme HIIT](/workout-plan/extreme-hiit) if ready

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Sacrificing form for speed** - Quality reps beat sloppy fast reps
- **Not resting enough** - Rest periods allow you to maintain intensity
- **Overtraining** - Don't do this every day - rest is crucial
- **Skipping warm-up/cool-down** - Essential for performance and recovery
- **Poor nutrition** - Fuel properly to maximize results
- **Comparing to others** - Focus on your own progress

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I do this program?

3-4 times per week is optimal. Allow at least one rest day between sessions. Your body needs recovery time to adapt and get stronger.

### Will this help me lose weight?

Yes, when combined with proper nutrition. This program burns significant calories and builds muscle, which increases metabolism. However, nutrition is crucial - you can't out-train a poor diet.

### Can I do this program every day?

No. High-intensity circuit training requires recovery time. Overtraining leads to injury, burnout, and decreased performance. Stick to 3-4 sessions per week.

### What if I can't complete all 4 rounds?

Start with 2-3 rounds and build up gradually. It's better to complete fewer rounds with good form than to struggle through more rounds with poor form.

### Should I combine this with other training?

Yes, but be strategic. This program pairs well with light cardio or yoga on rest days. Avoid combining with other intense programs that might interfere with recovery.

### How long until I see results?

Most people notice improved endurance and energy within 2-3 weeks. Visible changes in body composition typically occur after 6-12 weeks when combined with proper nutrition.
